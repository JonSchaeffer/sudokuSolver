Solver Algorithm ideas

Checks -

All columns, rows, and squares must equal 45.
All columns, rows, and squares cannot repeat a number.

Start with number 1, and check every square first, then row, then number to see if it fits anywhere. Cycle through and repeat each number until the board is complete.
Find squares, rows, or columns with the least amount of empty spaces, rank the missing numbers and fill. Go back to the first idea and finish.
